# Genetic Algorithm Template
This repo is intended to be a template for a basic genetic algorithm. It maximizes the fitness of an array of agents using principles of natural selection. <br/>
Todo:
1. More interesting/reliable test 
2. Better genetic uniqueness calculation (Perhaps distance to closest agent rather than distance from mean)
3. Encourage speciation: similar agents are more likely to reproduce
