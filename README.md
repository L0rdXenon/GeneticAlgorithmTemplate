# Genetic Algorithm Template
This repo is intended to be a template for a basic genetic algorithm. It maximizes the fitness of an array of agents using principles of natural selection. <br/>
Todo:
1. Reproduction functionality overhaul
2. More interesting/reliable test 
3. Change subclasses to .py files for easier bugfixing
4. Encourage speciation: similar agents are more likely to reproduce
