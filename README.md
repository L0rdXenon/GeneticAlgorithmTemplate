# Genetic Algorithm Template
**BinaryAgent** is a template for a basic genetic algorithm. It maximizes the number of 1s in a given array of 1s or 0s using principles of natural selection. <br/>
**NumericalIntegerAgent** is a template for a genetic algorithm that works for any agent represented by an array of integers. This example seeks to make all values as close to 7 as possible
