# Genetic Algorithm Template
This repo is intended to be a template for a basic genetic algorithm. It maximizes the fitness of an array of agents using principles of natural selection. <br/><br/>
Todo:
1. Reproduction functionality overhaul
2. Mutation Rate parameter within each creature which can be mutated. (Evolve correct mutation rate to maximize fitness)
3. More interesting/reliable test 
5. Encourage speciation: similar agents are more likely to reproduce
